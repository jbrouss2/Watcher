                <h5>Project Purpose</h5>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this site is to build and maintain skills in HTML/JavaScript/CSS. 
                    Additionally, it is to serve as a personal portofilo in order to highlight a specific project.
                    This site is meant to encourage and influence learning of front-end ideas centered around
                    UI/UX Design. It also is to help maintain an interest in CS and keep it more fun and laid back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, this site will be used to build upon some skills learned during my internship at
                    Bechtel. I will be able to showcase some things on here since I cannot show any of the projects
                    that I worked on with the company for security purposes. It will essentially be a portfolio 
                    highlighting some of the skills that I learned while at Bechtel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project will also help hone in my research and design skills. As I plan to research and decide
                    which database to use as well as dashboard builder to use. After I finish doing this project in 
                    html, css, and JavaScript, I will then do a version in React.JS and potentially use Figma to design
                    the front-end look of the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have linked the research page on the <a href="projectBackground.html">project background</a> page.
                    It has a list of the different components that I thought about using and a pro/cons list for each. My 
                    final database decision was - and the Dashboard will be designed with -.
