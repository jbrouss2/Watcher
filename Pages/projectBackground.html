            <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
            <p>This project stemmed from wanting to do a personal project as well as improve my current skills.</p>
            <p>
                I plan to use HTML/CSS to create a website. Then I will use some sort of database to store my Information.
                I will then use a tool to create dashboards.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the current iteration, I plan to use MariaDB Database to store my information. Then I will use PowerBi 
                to create the dashboards.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next iteration, I plan to use a different Database to store my information. Then I plan to user
                Tableau to create the Dashboards.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, I decided that I will use different platforms to create this same project. This will be the 
                first iteration with basic HTML/CSS and potentially some JavaScript. Then I will use a framework to
                create the second iteration. I may choose reactjs or php. This will require some research which I will
                put on this current website. Finally, I will use figma to design the website before utilizing their
                functionality to convert to react js code.
            </p>

            <h2>Database Journey</h2>
            <p>
                This section will highlight how the creation and population of the database tables went. It will explain
                how I went about using the database that I chose. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing I did was download and install MariaDB. Then, I began to look into that to start populating 
                the tables. I plan to manually populate the tables for now before evenutally setting up a way to send information
                into the database.

                I will populate the tables with the information from the existing spreadsheet. After this, I will make a way so 
                that new information can be added without having to manually add it to the table
            </p>
